# Should

    - ASIO tcp/udp I/O thread, with option to auto-reconnect
    - Graphics view with drawing primitives
        - optimized for animations?
    - Port drawing syntax from QLuaRT
        - including PDF generation!
    - LineEditor API completion
    - Design A component, to copy, move and delete files.
        - Maybe just one?
        - Maybe for complete hierarchies
        - With progress feedback!
        - With async I/O if possible?
            - For this definitively decouple the I/O component
              from the dir hierarchy copy/move

# Maybe

    - Maybe: Port dynInputDlg?
